<p>
    I am a Master student in the school of Computer and Communication Sciences at <a href="http://epfl.ch"> EPFL </a>. 
    I did my undergraduate study in the school of Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://www.xjtu.edu.cn">Xi'an Jiaotong University </a>in China.

    My interests include computer graphics, machine learning, and deep learning. 
    And I love games! I am working on my best to be a fun and creative game developer.
    See some of my projects <a href=""projects>here </a>. 
    Also I've put my notes or something else here <a href="blogs/blogs">blogs</a>.

    Outside my curriculum, I have been fascinated by outdoor activities here in Switzerland. 
    You can find me hiking, skiing, or snowboarding in the mountains.
    I enjoy music and I play the 琵琶(pipa) since I was a kid and I am self-teaching guitar as well. 
    But they are just too heavy to bring overseas. So I just listen to music now !
    Recently repeated listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBfZoA4hQPg">24 Capriceses</a>. I love 20 and 11 the most.
